useEffect Execution Timeline
- React renders the DOM.
- Browser paints the updated DOM.
- useEffect runs and GSAP applies animations.
- Result: A potential flicker or layout shift may occur before GSAP styles are applied.
- use if animations:
- Do not depend heavily on precise DOM layout measurements (e.g., static elements).
- Are simple and fast, where any delay isn't noticeable.
- Do not involve scroll-triggered behaviors like GSAP's ScrollTrigger.



useLayoutEffect Execution Timeline
- React renders the DOM.
- useLayoutEffect runs before the browser paints.
- GSAP applies animations or styles immediately.
- Browser paints the DOM with GSAP styles already applied.
- Result: No flicker or layout shift.


When using Lenis (or any custom smooth scrolling library), the default behavior of GSAP ScrollTrigger won't work as intended because ScrollTrigger listens to the browser's native scroll events, while Lenis manipulates the scroll position using transforms or other techniques. This discrepancy creates a mismatch between what ScrollTrigger expects and what actually happens on the page.

To fix this, scrollerProxy is used to synchronize ScrollTrigger with the custom smooth scrolling logic provided by Lenis. It ensures that ScrollTrigger correctly tracks the scroll position and dimensions of your custom scroll container.
